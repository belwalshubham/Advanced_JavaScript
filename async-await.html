    <p> Async: It simply allows us to write promises based code as if it was synchronous and it checks that we are not breaking the execution thread. It operates asynchronously via the event-loop. Async functions will always return a value. It makes sure
        that a promise is returned and if it is not returned then javascript automatically wraps it in a promise which is resolved with its value</p>
    <p>Await: Await function is used to wait for the promise. It could be used within the async block only. It makes the code wait until the promise returns a result. It only makes the async block wait.</p>

    <script>
        // Async
        async function test() {
            return "hello";

        }
        test().then((result) => {
            console.log(result);

        });

        // Await
        //( mostly used when data is getting from server)
        // fetch function 

        async function test1() {
            console.log("2: Message");
            const response = await fetch("student_data.json");
            console.log("3: Message");
            const students = await response.json();
            return students;

        }
        console.log("1: Message");
        let a = test1();
        console.log("4: Message");
        console.log(a);
